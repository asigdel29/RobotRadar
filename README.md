# RobotRadar
The objective of this project is to design and implement an obstacle “radar” application for these robots. Using distance sensors, robots shall first detect obstacles in their path. In a second step, these obstacles shall be displayed on a suitable 360 degree user interface, In a third step, two such robots shall heuristically “decide” if the obstacles are the same one.
